-- | This module exports facilities allowing you to safely obtain, use and
-- release TLS-secured TCP connections within a /Pipes/ pipeline, by relying on
-- @pipes-safe@.
--
-- This module is meant to be used together with "Pipes.Network.TCP.TLS", and it
-- overrides some functions from "Network.Simple.TCP" so that they support
-- 'P.MonadSafe'. Additionally, it also exports pipes that establish a
-- TLS-secured TCP connection and interact with it unidirectionally, in a
-- streaming fashion at once.
--
-- You are encouraged to use this module together with "Pipes.Network.TCP.TLS"
-- and "Network.Simple.TCP.TLS" as follows:
--
-- @
-- import qualified "Network.Simple.TCP.TLS"     as TLS hiding (connect, serve, listen, accept)
-- import qualified "Pipes.Network.TCP.TLS"      as TLS
-- import qualified "Pipes.Network.TCP.TLS.Safe" as TLS
-- @

-- received from the remote end.

--
-- If the remote peer closes its side of the connection of EOF is reached, this
-- proxy returns.
